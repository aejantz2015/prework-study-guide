# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description
This project was created as a study guide for the prework of the course that I will be able to use and reference throughout the course. I learned how to start a project using HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript to form code and merge edited and update code to the original form. This helped me get my foot in the door for the bootcamp so that I am able to hit the ground running when classes start.
